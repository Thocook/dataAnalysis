## AI Projects

### BookEmbeddings

This project demonstrates the use of AI for semantic text search. A book is broken down into paragraph-level chunks, and each chunk is embedded using OpenAI's text embedding API. When a user submits a query, it is also embedded and compared to the chunk embeddings using cosine similarity to return the most relevant passages from the book.
